This Privacy Policy explains the information Banditos collects through the احسب معدليك app, how it is used, and your rights concerning the collection and use of your data. Banditos provides this app as a free service, and by using it, you agree to the collection and use of personal information as outlined in this policy.

This Privacy Policy complies with the regulations set forth by AppGallery, and we are committed to protecting your privacy while using our app. We only collect and process data necessary to improve our services, in compliance with legal requirements, including GDPR where applicable. The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.

Information Collection and Use
For an enhanced experience while using our Service, we may collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, gender, location, and profile pictures. We collect this information only after obtaining your explicit consent and ensure that it is used solely for improving the app’s functionality.

The app integrates third-party services, such as [AdMob] (for ads), which may also collect information like your Android ID. These third parties comply with all privacy laws and are obligated to handle your data securely. Any information collected will only be shared as described in this policy and with your explicit consent.

Privacy Tag
We are transparent about the types of data collected, their purpose, and how they are processed. You can review the privacy tag details on Huawei AppGallery before installing the app to understand the data collection specifics.

Cookies
Our app does not explicitly use cookies. However, third-party services integrated with our app (such as analytics providers) may use cookies to collect information for improving their services. You have the option to accept or refuse cookies, and if you choose to refuse them, some features of the app may not work as intended.

We may collect information from your device (such as the device ID, operating system, or app usage data) to improve app performance and security. This data will not identify you personally and will only be used for fraud prevention and to enhance user experience.

Service Providers
We may work with third-party companies and individuals to:

Facilitate our Service;
Provide the Service on our behalf;
